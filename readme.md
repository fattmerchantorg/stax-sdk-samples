## Stax SDK Sample Applications

#### Contained within this codebase are two separate sample applications that leverage the Stax IOS SDK. The first (contained within the Storyboard directory) is a legacy application built using UIKit, the second (contained within the Swift UI directory) is a newer application build using SwiftUI.

#### Other than their base technology, both applications are identical in design and functionality.

#### Getting Started:

#### In order to run these applications, the following steps need to occur:

 1. Run the pod install command at the root directory

2. Open the main stax-sdk-samples directory in xcode

3. Ensure you replace the associated project's apiKey value with your prod Stax API key

4. Select your desired project target in the dropdown menu, either Fattmerchant-iOS-SDK-sample (the legacy application) or Sample App (Swift UI)

5. Build your selected project and voila! You will see your application in your selected device simulator.
